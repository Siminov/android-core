The Siminov Framework team provide release bundles hosted at Github File Release System, in ZIP and TGZ formats. Each release bundle contains build files, documentation, source code, and other goodness. Each platform has its own specific build files.

You can download releases of Siminov Framework, in your chosen format, from the list
at [Builds](http://siminov.com/build.html).

- The build directory contains all the required files. All the build files in this directory must also be included in your project.
